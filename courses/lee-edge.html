            <h1>The Everyday Waterfront<br>Reimagining the Lee Edge</h1>
            <p class="ptext">
                This studio invites students to reimagine the edge of the Lee Navigation not as a residual boundary or scenic backdrop, but as a shared, lived environment that forms part of everyday routines, collective use, and long-term ecological processes.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                In the UK context, urban waterways have historically been treated as technical corridors, redundant spaces, or regulated zones of risk management shaped more by engineering, ownership, and liability than by civic life. This studio asks how the waterfront might instead operate as an active public realm that is socially inclusive, spatially generous, and ecologically productive.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                Students will work on a site that sits at the intersection of three neighbourhoods in London’s East End that are currently undergoing significant transformation: Sweetwater and East Wick, Hackney Wick, and Fish Island. These areas are divided by the Lee Navigation and the Hertford Union Canal, which cut across the site along north–south and east–west axes
