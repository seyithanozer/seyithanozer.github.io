          <h1>Housing for Culture in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London</h1>
          <p class="ptext">This design studio offered to MArch Artchitecture and Urbanism students, investigates the spatial relationships and synergies between housing and culture. It invites students to rethink housing as a framework that actively engages with and supports cultural activities. A particular attention is paid to the design of public and common spaces within and around housing that strengthens these relationships and enhances community life, inclusivity, and creative opportunities. At a more technical level, the studio invites students to rethink the mainstream housing production techniques (materials, aesthetics, structures) and propose sustainable alternatives.</p><br>

          <p class="ptext">In this studio, students will be working on a site in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London.</p>
