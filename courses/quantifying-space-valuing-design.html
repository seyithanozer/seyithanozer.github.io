          <h1>Quantifying Space, Valuing Design</h1>
          <p class="ptext">This is a theory- and practice-based module for first-year MArch students. This semester’s theme, 'Quantifying Space, Valuing Design', examines the relationship between advanced digital tools and the values that inform architectural decision-making.</p><br>
          <p class="ptext">The module introduces students to the principles and applications of parametric design, developing skills in structuring rules, parameters, and relationships to generate, test and evaluate neighbourhood-scale design options. Alongside technical proficiency, students are required to ground their design strategies in evidence-based research, identifying priorities across the social, economic and environmental dimensions of architecture. These may include affordability, equality and well-being, as well as resource efficiency, carbon reduction and climate resilience.</p><br>
          <p class="ptext">By embedding such values directly into parametric models, students are challenged to navigate the complexities of competing priorities, making explicit the trade-offs inherent in design practice. The module encourages critical reflection on a central question for contemporary practice: <em>how can we measure what matters, while recognising the limits of measurement?</em></p><br>

          <p class="ptext">Throughout the semester, students will produce a 3,000+-word research-based essay presenting your argument on the following question:<br><br>How should we design new (greenfield) residential neighbourhoods at the fringes of London, with respect to urban morphology, density, and building form?<br><br>The essays will use parametric design tools as ways to test different design options. Students are expected to produce a set of reproducible Grasshopper experiments to generate alternative morphologies, densities and building forms. They will then evaluate these alternatives based on a review of the contemporary literature on the social and environmental value of housing forms. In this way, their work is research-driven both through computational trials in Grasshopper and through engagement with academic literature.</p><br>

          <p class="ptext">Parametric design on its own does not provide answers. It should be understood as a design system capable of producing multiple iterations in a short period of time. The responsibility of selecting an appropriate design remains with the designer, demanding critical thinking and judgement. These evaluative skills are increasingly important given the widening applications of AI tools in architecture and urban design. This module aims to support the development of such skills.</p><br>
