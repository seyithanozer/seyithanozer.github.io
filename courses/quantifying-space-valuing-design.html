          <h1>Quantifying Space, Valuing Design</h1>
          <p class="ptext">Emerging Research in Architecture is a theory- and practice-based module for first-year MArch students at the University of Hertfordshire. This semester’s theme, 'Quantifying Space, Valuing Design', examines the relationship between advanced digital tools and the values that inform architectural decision-making.</p><br>
          <p class="ptext">The module introduces students to the principles and applications of parametric design, developing skills in structuring rules, parameters, and relationships to generate, test and evaluate neighbourhood-scale design options. Alongside technical proficiency, students are required to ground their design strategies in evidence-based research, identifying priorities across the social, economic and environmental dimensions of architecture. These may include affordability, equality and well-being, as well as resource efficiency, carbon reduction and climate resilience.</p><br>
          <p class="ptext">By embedding such values directly into parametric models, students are challenged to navigate the complexities of competing priorities, making explicit the trade-offs inherent in design practice. The module encourages critical reflection on a central question for contemporary practice: <em>how can we measure what matters, while recognising the limits of measurement?</em></p><br>
