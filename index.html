          In this paper, I reflect on my PhD findings on extensions and conversions in terraced houses in London. In the past century, many terraced houses, the standard housing typology of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup>  centuries, were extended and converted, their interiors were remodelled in response to the changing user needs and housing shortage. The spatial changes in the older terraced houses offer, potentially, a valuable insight into the spatial needs and preferences at home.
