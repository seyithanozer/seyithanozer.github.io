            <h3>Architecture, materiality and climate in history</h3>
            <p class="ptext">
                This course is the history and theory module for second year architecture students at the University of Hertfordshire. The aim of this module is to develop critical thinking and an understanding of the social, political and cultural contexts in architectural practice. This module is designed around mass-produced building materials, steel, concrete, glass and plastic. Lectures focus on these materials and trace relevant historical concepts, design approaches and key historical buildings from industrial revolution to present and across different geographies. Such an organisation, while introducing students to key figures, buildings and historical and theoretical issues in architectural history, underscores the intersections of materiality with social and environmental considerations.

            Students will have two assignments. For the first assignment, they will choose a material they work with such as steel, concrete, wood, fabric etc. Each student will submit a portfolio of writing that contains three short texts and examine this material from several points of view. These include:<br><br>
            + A short essay on a contemporary building that focuses on the asthetic and cultural properties of its material use. Students must visit this building and their reviews should  be based on their experience of the selected material in the building. Students can consult Sam Johnson-Schlee (2022) <em>Living Rooms</em>. London: Peninsula Press, and Calder, Barnabas (2022) <em>Raw Concrete: The Beauty of Brutalism</em>. London: Penguin for understanding the expected style of writing.<br><br>
            + A short essay on the significance and use of this material in the history of architecture. Students should consult not only the readings assigned throughout the lectures (compulsory) but also the library and online resources.<br><br>
            + A short essay on the environmental impacts of this material focusing on its lifecycle. This includes the product, construction, use and end of life stages. Students can consult the EN 15978 and EN 15804 standards for detailed descriptions of these stages.<br><br>
            For the second assignment, students are expected to write a 2500 words academic essay relating to one of the lectures. This may be a material, a building, a historical concept, or a figure.
