            <h3>Architecture, materiality and climate in history</h3>
            <p class="ptext">
                This course is the history and theory module for second year architecture students at the University of Hertfordshire. The aim of this module is to develop critical thinking and an understanding of the social, political and cultural contexts in architectural practice. This module is designed around mass-produced building materials, steel, concrete, glass and plastic. Lectures focus on these materials and trace relevant historical concepts, design approaches and key historical buildings from industrial revolution to present and across different geographies. Such an organisation, while introducing students to key figures, buildings and historical and theoretical issues in architectural history, underscores the intersections of materiality with social and environmental considerations.
