          <h1>Architecture, materiality and climate in history</h1>
          <p class="ptext">
              This course is the history and theory module for second year architecture students at the University of Hertfordshire. The aim of this module is to develop critical thinking and an understanding of the social, political and cultural contexts in architectural practice. Lectures focus on mass-produced building materials, steel, concrete, glass and plastic and trace relevant historical concepts, design approaches and key historical buildings from industrial revolution to present and across different geographies. They underscore the intersections of materiality with social and environmental considerations, while introducing students to key figures, buildings and historical and theoretical issues in architectural history.

          <p class="ptext">
            Students are required to choose a material they work with such as steel, concrete, wood, fabric etc. and submit a portfolio of writing that contains three short texts that examine this material from several points of view. These include:
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="ptext-indented">
            (1) A short essay on a contemporary building that focuses on the asthetic and cultural properties of its material use. Students must visit this building and their reviews should be based on their experience of the selected material in the building.<br><br> 
            (2) A short essay on the significance and use of this material in the history of architecture. Students should consult not only the readings assigned throughout the lectures (compulsory) but also the library and online resources.<br><br>
            (3) A short essay on the environmental impacts of this material focusing on its lifecycle. This includes the product, construction, use and end of life stages. Students can consult the EN 15978 and EN 15804 standards for detailed descriptions of these stages.</p><br>
          <p class="ptext">Students can consult the following sources for understanding the expected types of writing in (1) and (2):</p><br>

          <p class="ptext">
            Students are required to submit a 2000-word research paper on one of the four following themes:
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="ptext-indented">
            (1) Select one building (from the lectures) and write an essay focusing on its relationship to its architectural context. For example, how does this building exemplify a certain architectural style? What architectural features make us identify this building with that architectural style?<br><br>
            (2) Select an architect (from the lectures) and write an essay on their architectural works. For example, what makes this architect’s works significant? What are the continuities, repetitions, improvements, and changes in this person’s work?<br><br>
            (3) Select one building (from the lectures) and write an essay focusing on its material use. How are the materials used and why? How do they relate to the spaces they are used in and to the broader cultural and aesthetic contexts?<br><br>
            (4) Select an architectural element (from the lectures, e.g. curtain wall, brise-soleil) and write an essay on its use and development since the 20th century.<br><br>
