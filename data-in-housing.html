          <h1>Evidence-based Housing Design</h1>
          <p class="ptext">Emerging Research in Architecture is a theory and practice-based module for first-year MArch students at the University of Hertfordshire. The aim of this module is to equip students with a range of research tools, techniques and practices to incorporate a data-driven approach in their decision-making process. At the end of this course, students will improve their skills in analysing current trends in the context of architectural culture, theory or design and showing how it has informed and supported their design project; in evaluating and applying appropriate research methods, methodologies and techniques to design process; and in synthesising and presenting written and visual information and communicate ideas, arguments and conclusions to a post-graduate level.</p><br>

          <p class="ptext">Throughout the term, students will be working towards <b>a design and research manual for good housing</b>. This manual will be an A4 booklet and will include:</p>
          <p class="ptext-indented-bold">(1) A statement on what constitutes good housing</p>
          <p class="ptext-indented">The statement is expected to cover and expand on the themes discussed during the lectures lectures will focus on four themes — functionality, feeling of home, energy, and affordability.</p>

          <p class="ptext-indented-bold">(2) Diagrams showing design considerations for good housing</p>
          <p class="ptext-indented">These design considerations should relate to each of the four themes discussed in the lectures and must be supported by statements on how they respond to these themes. They might relate to housing at any scale, from neighbourhoods to buildings, units, rooms and construction details. They must be data– and research–driven and supported by visual (where possible) representations of relevant primary and secondary data (see weekly exercises).</p>
          
          <p class="ptext-indented-bold">(3) Research considerations for good housing</p>
          <p class="ptext-indented">As students research and analyse existing or newly-generated data, they should also consider further research required in the themes they are interested in. These considerations should be supported by research designs.</p>

          <p class="ptext-indented-bold">(4) Exemplary applications of design considerations</p>
          <p class="ptext-indented">In their final submission, students should include an application of their design considerations for good housing (2) in relation to their design studio project.</p>

          <p class="ptext-bold">Pool of Working Resources (Weeks 1-2)</p>
          <p class="ptext">Students will start by creating a pool of housing examples. These will be obtained from <a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/">Zoopla</a> and <a href="https://www.rightmove.co.uk/">Rightmove</a>. Every student will find two dwellings that are ‘similar’ to their own or family homes. Students should pay attention to the type (purpose-built flats, terraced, semi-detached or detached houses); size (in terms of both floor area and number of rooms); and layout in deciding on their similarity. This initial documentation should consist of: 1) Site plan of neighbourhoods (see: <a href="https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/">Digimap</a>), (2) Photographs, (3) Redrawn floor plans that include the furniture (the furniture will be drawn by using the available photographs and approximating dimensions).</p>
