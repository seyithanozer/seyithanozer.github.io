            <b>Essays</b>
            <br>
            Essays are shorter pieces of academic writing that allow you to explore a topic, present arguments, and demonstrate your understanding. They are common in the first years of undergraduate study and help you develop essential skills such as how to structure arguments, engage with sources, and think critically, all of which are crucial for independent research.
            <br><br>
            <b>Dissertations</b>
            <br>
            A dissertation is a <em>research</em> project completed as part of an undergraduate or postgraduate degree (see Research). It gives you the opportunity to explore a topic that interests you in depth and to present your findings in response to a question you have developed yourself. Writing a dissertation is your chance to show your ability to carry out independent research and to engage critically with your chosen topic.
            <br><br>
            <b>Undergraduate Dissertation</b>
            <br>
            An undergraduate dissertation demonstrates your ability to conduct independent research at a basic level. It usually focuses on a narrow topic, often applying existing theories with limited originality, and relies mainly on secondary sources (see Literature Review).
            <br><br>
            <b>Postgraduate (Master’s) Dissertation</b>
            <br>
            A Master’s dissertation shows more advanced research skills and deeper engagement with the field. It usually involves some primary data (see Research Methods).

            <b>Research</b>
            <br><br>
            Research is a systematic inquiry directed toward the creation of knowledge. It is 'the process by which you understand the world in a verifiable and consistent manner... Merely collating information is not enough to constitute research, however - the aim is to say something meaningful as a result of the data gathered' (Lucas, 2016).
            <br><br>
            By 'verifiable', we mean that your findings can be checked or tested by others. In other words, your methods and results are transparent, so someone else could repeat the study and see whether they reach similar conclusions. This ensures that your work is trustworthy and not based on guesswork or opinion.
            <br><br>
            By 'consistent', we mean that research follows a clear and logical process rather than being random or ad hoc. The steps you take should be well-documented, systematic and replicable. Consistency allows researchers to compare results across studies, build on previous knowledge, and contribute meaningfully to a wider understanding of a topic.
            <br><br>
            Research usually follows a clear, structured process to ensure that the work is rigorous, meaningful, and trustworthy. While every project is unique, most research involves four key stages:
            <br><br>
            <b>Problem Definition</b>
            <br>
            The first step is to identify what you are researching and why it matters. This involves clearly defining the problem, question, or topic that your study will address. A well-defined problem gives your research direction and focus.
             <br><br>
            <b>Literature Review</b>
            <br>
            Once the problem is defined, you explore what others have already discovered. Reviewing existing research helps you understand the current state of knowledge, identify gaps, and avoid duplicating previous work. It also provides a foundation for your own study and helps justify why your research is necessary.
            <br><br>
            <b>Systematic Inquiry</b>
            <br>
            This stage involves planning and carrying out your research in a structured way. You decide on the methods you will use, collect data carefully, and analyse it consistently. Whether you use quantitative, qualitative, or design-based methods, your approach should be transparent and reproducible so that others can verify your results.
            <br><br>
            <b>Logical Reflection</b>
            <br>
            Finally, you interpret and evaluate your findings. What have you discovered, and what is the significance of your results? Reflecting on the outcomes allows you to draw conclusions, consider their implications, and suggest areas for further research. This step transforms raw data into meaningful knowledge.

            <b>Research Methods</b>
            <br><br>
            When choosing a research method, the most important starting point is your research question. Your question should show what kind of answer you are looking for—for example, “how many?” versus “how?” If your question is about measuring, testing, or evaluating relationships using numbers, a quantitative approach is usually best. If you want to explore experiences, meanings, or processes in depth, a qualitative approach will be more suitable.
            <br><br>
            <img src="/images/Research Methods.svg" alt="Description of the image" width="400" display="block">
            <br><br>
            Design-based research involves creating, testing, or refining a product, model, or intervention. However, it is also important to collect some form of evaluative data at the end.This could be a reflection, feedback from users, or results from a simulation to show what worked, what did not, and why.
            <br><br>
            Once you know whether your project is primarily quantitative, qualitative, or design-based, you can choose a specific method within that category. Quantitative methods include surveys, experiments, or statistical analysis. Qualitative methods might involve interviews, focus groups, case studies, observations, or analysing documents and conversations. 
            <br><br>
            Sometimes, more than one method could work for your question. When that happens, it is important to think about what is realistic. Consider how much time you have, what skills you already have (or are willing to learn), and what resources are available, like access to participants, data, or special equipment. A method that looks perfect in theory might be too ambitious in practice, so it is important to balance your goals with what is achievable.
            <br><br>
            Finally, remember that you will need to justify your choice in your dissertation. It is not enough to simply state which method you are using; you should also explain why it is the most appropriate option and how it helps you achieve your research aims more effectively than the alternatives. Showing this awareness strengthens your work and demonstrates that your project is well designed.

            <b>Diagrammatic Analysis of Buildings</b>
            <br><br>
            Diagrams are an essential tool in the analysis of architectural precedents because they allow designers and researchers to distill complex buildings into their essential characteristics and relationships. Unlike photographs or fully detailed drawings, diagrams simplify and abstract information, making it easier to identify patterns, hierarchies, and functional arrangements.
            <br><br>
            This abstraction is particularly valuable when comparing buildings of different styles, periods, or scales. Through diagrammatic analysis, it becomes possible to identify underlying strategies and design principles, regardless of formal differences.
            <br><br>
            The example below is the Circulation to Use diagram of the Stockholm Public Library, showing how people move through a building and where that movement intersects with zones of use.

            <b>Using AI Tools</b>
            <br><br>
            AI tools are now embedded in much of the software we use to design, draft, and write. You may choose to use AI in your own research, but you must be careful of the errors and false claims produced by AI.
            <br><br>
            Generative AI poses particular risks in the context of academic research. It is prone to error when asked about books, journal articles, or references, and it often fabricates titles that do not exist.
            <br><br>
            Generative AI can sometimes be useful as a text editor, helping you to improve clarity or style. However, when used as a text generator, it generally presents ideas without nuance or criticality and often misuses jargon or technical terms. As a result, it often produces content that is below the level expected from academic research.
            <br><br>
            Generative AI should not be asked research questions, nor should it be relied on to supply references. It may, however, be used to help you understand background concepts or to clarify material that you find difficult to comprehend.
            <br><br>
            You should also be aware of the broader ethical and academic issues surrounding the use of AI. Generative AI is trained on vast amounts of material, much of it without acknowledgement. Submitting its outputs directly constitutes a form of plagiarism. In addition, AI outputs are not replicable, which undermines their reliability as research material. You are therefore strongly encouraged to avoid reliance on AI as a substitute for your own research.
            <br><br>
            You should further note that AI systems consume significant amounts of energy, particularly for image generation.
            <br><br>
            If you do make use of AI, you must acknowledge when and how it has been used in your work. This can take the form of an “Acknowledgment” section at the end of your essay, with proper referencing.
            <br><br>
            AI can support your learning, but it should never replace your own engagement, judgment, or creativity.
