            <h3>Rebuilding the Terraced House: Contemporary spatial norms in the older housing stock</h3>
            <p class="ptext">
                The speculative terraced houses of nineteenth-century England continue to characterise London’s residential environment.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">According to Valuation Office Agency statistics for 2018, 35% of the dwelling units in London were built before 1900 and 51% before 1939, and most of these were houses. Valuation Office Agency, ‘CTSOP 3.1: Number of properties by Council Tax band, property build period and region, county, local authority district and lower and middle super output area’, in Council Tax: Stock of Properties, 2018, https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/council-tax-stock-of-properties-2018.</small></span> While their exteriors largely retain the highly standardised original architectural features, their interiors have been altered in various ways. Some of them had their interior layouts reorganised, some were extended and enlarged towards the backyard, the attic, and in some cases, below ground, and some others, especially those in central areas, were partitioned into flats.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">According to the 2011 edition of the English Housing Survey, in the UK, 73.5% of dwellings built before 1919 (which are largely Victorian terraced houses) had at least one major alteration such as (from the most common to the least) extensions, rearrangement of internal space, complete refurbishment, conversion to more than one dwelling and loft conversions. Department for Communities & Local Government, 'English Housing Survey: HOMES - Annual Report on England’s Housing Stock, 2011' (London: Department for Communities and Local Government, 2013), Annex Table AT1.21: Dwellings with any major modifications since built by dwelling age, 2011.</small></span> However varied the motivations and means of their homeowners and the domestic spaces they created might be, these alterations are aimed at keeping the housing infrastructure in line with the contemporary expectations from and understandings of dwellings and domestic spaces.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                A study of terraced house alterations can reveal how contemporary spatial norms are understood, translated, negotiated and reproduced within the Victorian terraced house. In this chapter, I present some findings from a study using both quantitative and qualitative research methods including a visual study of floor plans submitted as part of planning applications, and interview data gathered from owner-occupants in London to explore some directions for future research.

            <h4>Alterations and Spatial Norms</h4>
            <p class="ptext">
                To think about home alterations and spatial norms means to attend, on the one hand, to the everyday — the functional uses of homes, needs, preferences and practices of owners and owner-occupants, and meanings of home, and on the other, to the broader issues in housing such as the lack of affordability and housing availability, financialization of housing, asset-based welfare, and gentrification.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                The relationship between the material domestic space and the everyday has multiple dimensions.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Denise L. Lawrence and Setha M. Low, 'The Built Environment and Spatial Form', Annual Review of Anthropology 19, no. 1 (1990): 453–505; Thomas F. Gieryn, 'A Space for Place in Sociology', Annual Review of Sociology 26, no. 1 (2000): 463–96; Setha M. Low and Denise Lawrence-Zúñiga, eds., The Anthropology of Space and Place: Locating Culture (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2003); Hilde Heynen, 'Space as Receptor, Instrument or Stage: Notes on the Interaction Between Spatial and Social Constellations', International Planning Studies 18, no. 3–4 (2013): 342–57.</small></span> First, the built form of dwellings embody certain ideologies of home, that are the ‘dominant  conventions  about  both  the  conduct  of  relationships  within  the  household  and  the relationship of the household to the outside world’.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Alison Blunt and Robyn Dowling, Home (London: Routledge, 2006).</small></span> The Victorian terraced house was a speculative product and its design was largely influenced by legislation and the construction economy.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Harold James Dyos, 'The Speculative Builders and Developers of Victorian London', Victorian Studies, Supplement: Symposium on the Victorian City (2), 11 (1968): 641–90; John Burnett, A Social History of Housing: 1815-1970 (Newton Abbot: David & Charles, 1978).</small></span> It was highly standardised in its dimensions, layouts and materials, thanks to the pattern books that allowed any speculative developer to build them.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Dyos, 'The Speculative Builders and Developers of Victorian London'.</small></span> However, its design — size, spatial organisation, and materials — still reflected the labour and care practices, and morals of the nineteenth century family. The typical by-law house, which had a deep floor plate with a narrow street frontage and a small backyard, was vertically separated into day and night uses with common areas (day) located on the ground floor, and bedrooms (night), on the upper floors. It had three rooms on the ground floor, a parlour, a living room, and a scullery, that were organised from entrance to backyard in an order from public to private and clean to dirty.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Roderick J Lawrence, 'The Organization of Domestic Space', Ekistics, January 1, 1979, 135–39; Ritsuko Ozaki, 'The `front’ and `back’ Regions of the English House: Changing Values and Lifestyles', Journal of Housing and the Built Environment 18, no. 2 (2003): 105–27; Richard Roger, Housing in Urban Britain 1780-1914, New Studies in Economic and Social History (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1989); Victoria Kelley, '“The Virtues of a Drop of Cleansing Water”: Domestic Work and Cleanliness in the British Working Classes, 1880–1914', Women’s History Review 18, no. 5 (2009): 719–35.</small></span> The parlour or front room was furnished with objects of status and was used for special occasions such as Sundays and holidays. The living room or kitchen was the heart of the home, used for sitting, meals, and interactions. The scullery or back kitchen, where the water supply was installed, was dedicated to specific dirty tasks, such as washing up and laundry, and was not a space to be in. The WC was out in the backyard. On the first floor, there were two or three bedrooms, zoned, with space permitting, according to age and gender (parents’ room, boys’ room, and girls’ room). These were often unheated and used only for sleeping.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                Inhabiting a dwelling entails a continuous process of adjustment of residents’ domestic practices in relation to the domestic material space, as well as of the domestic material space in relation to the residents’ domestic practices.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Blunt and Dowling, Home; Heynen, 'Space as Receptor, Instrument or Stage'; Henny Coolen, The Meaning of Dwelling Features: Conceptual and Methodological Issues (Delft: Delft University of Technology, 2008).</small></span>  Alterations made to terraced houses — a scullery fitted with a modern kitchen, a parlour used as a living room, the WC moved to the inside from the backyard, a full bathroom, a new loft bedroom, a larger kitchen with a back extension — are part of these adjustments. In addition to the motivations around energy performance and environmental comfort, the literature highlights cleanliness, convenience, and modern living as significant drivers.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Ellis P. Judson, Usha Iyer-Raniga, and Ralph Horne, 'Greening Heritage Housing: Understanding Homeowners’ Renovation Practices in Australia', Journal of Housing and the Built Environment 29, no. 1 (2014): 61–78.</small></span> Studying home extensions in York, Martin Hand and co-authors argued for the need for space for new technological appliances and changing understandings of  the kitchen — i.e. from a ‘back region’ to the ‘symbolic heart of home’ — as the reasons for the increasing size of kitchens.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Martin Hand, Elizabeth Shove, and Dale Southerton, 'Home Extensions in the United Kingdom: Space, Time, and Practice', Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 25, no. 4 (2005): 675–76.

Studying ‘green renovators’ of single-family houses in Melbourne, Australia, Cecily Maller and co-authors observed similar spatial changes and motivations: multiplying bathrooms and larger kitchens and open kitchens/living areas.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Cecily Maller, Ralph Horne, and Tony Dalton, 'Green Renovations: Intersections of Daily Routines, Housing Aspirations and Narratives of Environmental Sustainability', Housing, Theory and Society 29, no. 3 (2012): 255–75.</small></span>
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                Besides providing comfort and convenience, house alterations help establish and maintain meanings and feelings of home.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Julia Cook, 'Understanding Home Renovation as a Material Future-Making Practice', Sociology 55, no. 2 (2020): 384–99; Bronwyn Tanner, Cheryl Tilse, and Desleigh de Jonge, 'Restoring and Sustaining Home: The Impact of Home Modifications on the Meaning of Home for Older People', Journal of Housing For the Elderly 22, no. 3 (2008): 195–215.</small></span> Critical geographers of home recognise home as an affective space associated with feelings and meanings such as safety, identity, attachment, belonging, control, pride and status.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Hazel Easthope, 'A Place Called Home', Housing, Theory and Society 21, no. 3 (2004): 128–38.</small></span> As residents alter their homes, they exercise control over their dwelling and create new meanings attached to their dwelling. By re-designing the domestic space in relation to their needs and preferences, residents can express their identity and aesthetic preferences and enhance their status.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Michael Mackay and Harvey C. Perkins, 'DIY Dreams and the Potential of Home', Housing, Theory and Society 36, no. 1 (2019): 112–28; Minna Sunikka-Blank, Ray Galvin, and Carrie Behar, 'Harnessing Social Class, Taste and Gender for More Effective Policies', Building Research & Information 46, no. 1 (2017): 1–13; Elizabeth B. Silva and David Wright, 'Displaying Desire and Distinction in Housing', Cultural Sociology 3, no. 1 (2009): 31–50.</small></span> In this way alterations are also related to residents’ consumption choices and the decisions residents make when improving their houses are greatly influenced by the media, which contributes further to the reproduction of contemporary ideologies of home.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Aneta Podkalicka and Esther Milne, 'Diverse Media Practices and Economies of Australian Home Renovators: Budgeting, Self-Education and Documentation', Continuum 31, no. 5 (2017): 694–705; Shae Hunter, 'Reflexive Renovation and the Future of Household Sustainability: The Role of Media and Imagination in Household Consumption', Geographical Research 58, no. 3 (2020): 214–25.</small></span>
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                Terraced house alterations are entangled with other, largely economic, motivations. In the context of London, where housing affordability is a significant problem, older stock in need of repair have been an attractive option for homeownership, as well as for those who have been amateur property speculators.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Joe Moran, 'Early Cultures of Gentrification in London, 1955–1980', Journal of Urban History 34, no. 1 (2007): 101–21.</small></span> Tim Butler and Garry Robson note that ‘[t]he history of gentrification in London over the past nearly 40 years has been largely one of upgrading of mainly 19th century property by individuals or small-scale developers’.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Tim Butler and Garry Robson, 'Social Capital, Gentrification and Neighbourhood Change in London: A Comparison of Three South London Neighbourhoods', Urban Studies 38, no. 12 (2001): 2145–62. See also: Chris Hamnett, 'City Centre Gentrification: Loft Conversions in London’s City Fringe', Urban Policy and Research 27, no. 3 (2009): 277–87.</small></span>
                
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                Extensions and alterations might also be a more feasible alternative for existing homeowners, who would like to upsize, or more generally require more space. Research has indicated that space shortages relative to space standards are more present in the terraced housing stock.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Malcolm Morgan and Heather Cruickshank, 'Quantifying the Extent of Space Shortages: English Dwellings', Building Research & Information 42, no. 6 (2014): 710–24.</small></span> However, at the same time, dwellings with three or more bedrooms are overall limited in London and are largely in the terraced housing stock. Moreover, new builds in London are generally blocks of flats, which do not have certain amenities such as a backyard, which are highly valued by Londoners. Property prices virtually multiply with the number of bedrooms, making the costs of renovation significantly advantageous for households in need of more bedrooms.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                Homes ‘embody the majority of [owners’] savings and secure the bulk of their debt’.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Nicole Cook, Susan J. Smith, and Beverley A. Searle, 'Debted Objects: Homemaking in an Era of Mortgage-Enabled Consumption', Housing, Theory and Society 30, no. 3 (2013): 1–19.</small></span> Maintenance of and investment into homes, in the form of renovations and alterations, is also essential to the maintenance of the exchange value of homes, hence the savings of owners, and this is particularly important in an asset-based welfare system.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">John Doling and Richard Ronald, 'Home Ownership and Asset-Based Welfare', Journal of Housing and the Built Environment 25, no. 2 (2010): 165–73.</small></span> For instance, real estate websites list adding a bathroom, creating an open living space, extending the loft space for additional bedrooms, and even obtaining the planning permission for an extension as ways to maintain and increase property value.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">NAEA Propertymark, '“Doer-Uppers” Spent £48 Billion on Improvements', April 1, 2019.</small></span> Therefore, the actions of owner-occupiers rest on both homeownership and homemaking that entail two different forms of valuation. The extensions add new meanings and use value to homes, while also increasing their exchange value. Charles Gillon and Chris Gibson offer an alternative term, ‘investor-occupier’.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Charles Gillon and Chris Gibson, 'Calculated Homes, Stretched Emotions: Unmasking “Rational” Investor-Occupier Subjects in Large Family Homes in a Coastal Sydney Development', Emotion, Space and Society 26 (2018): 23–30.</small></span>

            <h4>A Study of Housing Design in London</h4>
            <p class="ptext">
                Here, I explore terraced house alterations using floor plan and interview data I collected for my PhD research that analysed design standardisation in the existing housing stock of London.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Seyithan Özer, 'Interior Complex: Design Standardization in London’s Housing' (Royal College of Art, 2021).</small></span> There is an established body of global literature in social sciences focusing on home repairs and renovations, their motivations, geographies, and meanings, and some of the relevant literature is reviewed above. While alterations are design activities, systematic analyses on the domestic spaces these major alterations produce are sparse. My aim is not to provide an extensive analysis of terraced house alterations, but to explore what kind of spaces they produce in London’s nineteenth century housing stock by highlighting some patterns I observed in the data.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                The floor plan data analysed was extracted from planning applications, which include surveys of existing dwellings and architectural drawings for proposed alterations. It included the floor plans for 120 terraced houses in a neighbourhood in East London. All the houses were two-storey, narrow-fronted terraced houses that were developed at once before 1900 in a highly standardised manner. While larger terraced houses in more central areas are largely converted into flats, smaller ones, usually in the Victorian urban fringes, are still used as single family homes.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Chris Hamnett, 'Gentrification and the Middle-Class Remaking of Inner London, 1961-2001', Urban Studies 40, no. 12 (2003): 2401–26.</small></span>
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                Planning applications were collected from the online planning system of the corresponding London borough. All boroughs in London, and in the UK in general, have created online systems through which planning applications that cover roughly the past ten years, can be accessed online. The selection of an East London neighbourhood was guided by such a limitation. East London has been witnessing expanding waves of gentrification, which has resulted in an intensifying change in the housing stock and this was evident in the number of planning applications submitted for the houses in the study area of around 400 houses in the past ten years. Moreover, it was evident from satellite images that the majority of houses in this neighbourhood did not have any previous extensions. It is also important to note that not all alterations require planning permission. For instance, interior changes, most of the time, do not require planning permission. Permitted development rights also allow back extensions without the need for planning permission if certain depth, height and volume requirements are satisfied. Generally, if the additions cover less than 50% of the plot area not covered by the dwelling, and extend no more than 3m from the original rear wall, then no planning applications are required.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, No. 596</small></span> Even though some permitted developments are also included in online systems, they mostly include applications for large extensions.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                Floor plans are first coded for the changes observed relative to the original terraced house layout. This included coding the type of extensions, the rooms and amenities added and removed, the changes made to walls separating the rooms in the original layout and the type of layouts they created. While it became clear that these codes were not sufficient to describe the diversity of ways terraced house interiors were changed, they allowed the description of spatial layouts and identification of repetitions. In addition to statistical descriptions, comparative matrices were used to analyse the varieties of spaces in dwellings falling into the same categories.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">
                While studying floor plans along a matrix gives an idea about the spatial patterns, they are limited in terms of linking these spatial changes to the understandings, framings and motivations of alterations. To address this, interview data that was collected as part of the same project was used.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Seyithan Özer and Alasdair Jones, 'Changing Socio-Spatial Definitions of Sufficiency of Home: Evidence from London (UK) before and during the Covid-19 Stay-at-Home Restrictions', International Journal of Housing Policy, 2022, 1–26.</small></span>While the data was collected to understand residents’ experiences with their homes and their understandings of sufficiency, participants, who had undertaken alteration projects, also referred to their motivations and the design processes. Even though the interview participants were not from the same neighbourhood, they have undertaken similar alterations, which allowed contextualising some of the spatial patterns and provided some directions for future research.
            </p>
            <h4>New Ground Floors in Terraced Houses</h4>
            <p class="ptext">All houses analysed were extended towards the back on the ground floor, enlarging the living areas. Even though there were a few extended ground floors in which the front rooms were used as bedrooms, additional bedrooms were generally created by loft extensions in the attic, keeping the original vertical day and night division.

            <p class="ptext"><br><br>Back extensions on ground floors were made in a number of ways. In some of them extensions were added to the back of the existing projections, where kitchens were located. In some others, extensions were added to the side of these projections, squaring off the originally L-shaped ground floors. In others, extensions were added in both directions, creating a deeper plan. Ranging up to 6m, these extensions brought the depth of ground floors to an average of 12m, and added, on average, 15m2 of floor space.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">Back extensions were rarely undertaken to create additional habitable rooms at the back of the ground floor. They were often designed to enlarge working kitchens, which, originally, were located at the back of the house. Only in a few dwellings were the kitchens left in the same size or moved to the middle room or to the front of the house. In most cases, working kitchens were enlarged with new living and dining spaces as well as longer worktops and more storage.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">However, kitchens were not only extended to the back of the house, but also combined and merged with the rooms in the main part of the building in a variety of ways. Walls separating extended kitchens from the middle rooms, and middle rooms from the front rooms, were variously moved or removed, or large openings were added to them. As a result, in new layouts, the separations between the three original rooms — parlour, living room, and kitchen — became less clear, and in some cases, non-existent. 
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">The additional floor area was also used to add new amenity spaces, i.e. bathrooms, WCs, storage, and utility rooms. Storage and utility rooms, which do not require natural lighting were mostly located in the middle of the floor plan.
            </p>
            <h4>Issues in Terraced House Alterations</h4>
            <p class="ptext">The most significant aspect of the new layouts was the rearrangement of the spatial organisation of the kitchen and living areas, which aligns with the wider changes in the understanding of kitchens and preferences in new-built housing. Since the 2000s, combined kitchen and living room arrangements have become the norm in London’s new-built dwellings.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Seyithan Özer and Sam Jacoby, 'Dwelling Size and Usability in London: A Study of Floor Plan Data Using Machine Learning', Building Research & Information, 2022, 1–15.</small></span> During interviews, participants reported a strong preference for combined kitchen and living room arrangements.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Özer and Jones, 'Sufficiency of Home'.</small></span> Participants referred to the inconvenience of having two separate spaces, a kitchen for the preparation and storage of meals and cleaning, and a dining room for the serving of meals. For instance, Jacob, who had just submitted a planning application for a back extension and layout change, reported: ‘we don't use the dining room […] we have enough space next to the kitchen, which is much easier to use. We're doing a little bit of rearrangement [...] an extension so that you can have the kitchen in the dining room.’ Irene Cieraad argued that separation of kitchens, living rooms and dining rooms sustained the gendered division of domestic spaces (who uses the kitchen for cooking, serving, cleaning), whereas the open plan reflected the ‘social equality between men and women, between parents and children’.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Irene Cieraad, '“Out of My Kitchen!” Architecture, Gender and Domestic Efficiency', The Journal of Architecture 7, no. 3 (2002): 263–79.</small></span> Moreover, studying the popular magazines on housekeeping in the last century, Martin Hand and Elizabeth Shove observed a shift towards an understanding of cooking and eating as ‘sociable lifestyle activities’ and kitchens as ‘the places of leisure and as places the whole family thinks of as home’.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">Martin Hand and Elizabeth Shove, 'Orchestrating Concepts: Kitchen Dynamics and Regime Change in Good Housekeeping and Ideal Home, 1922–2002', Home Cultures 1, no. 3 (2004): 245–47.</small></span> Interview participants acknowledged and referred to such understanding of the kitchen. For instance, Roshini, a working mum, who had recently built a side return extension noted that the older separation of living area into kitchen, dining room and living room did not work for them:
            <p class="ptext quote">
            [prior to the extension] it wasn't great spending time in the kitchen […] it was a bit more awkward [...] the kitchen was a much more functional space […] the middle room was a dining room, but it never got used […] having the extension meant that the dining area has moved into the kitchen and there is also a play area and a bit of extra living space.
            </p>
            <p class="ptext">While a pattern of enlarged and opened-up kitchens can be observed and can be related to the wider changes in domestic practices, these are spatially achieved in various ways. How can those differences be explained?

            <p class="ptext">For instance, in the interview data, financial considerations emerged. First, extensions require homeowners to have a certain level of financial capacity to cover the high costs of extensions.<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">According to Architecture for London, an architecture firm experienced in house extensions, a single-storey extension in London often costs between £2,000 and £3,000 per square metre.[2] This can easily amount to more than £50,000 for a project.</small></span> Second, homeowners need to justify their investment financially. One of the interview respondents, Marion, explained: ‘[We wanted to extend the kitchen] but again, it was financial [...] you wouldn't be able to actually increase the value of the property because there is a ceiling price on those two-bedroom properties whatever you do. [A kitchen extension] would be nice, but I think this is not my forever home and there is only so much money we want to spend.’ If the projected increase in the value of the house is an important consideration, as Marion suggested, then what are the spatial layouts that are more financially viable?

            <p class="ptext">The variety of extensions, conversions, and remodelling in the older housing stock proved that the terraced house typologies are flexible and they can accommodate a variety of living space arrangements, extra bedrooms and new amenities. The availability of space to extend backwards, double aspect design, and particularly, the disposition of entrance hall, staircase, and scullery on one side, and habitable rooms on the other, have enabled a variety of interior layouts.

            <p class="ptext">At the same time, new alterations seem to be limiting any further changes, as the ground floors have become deeper than before. The original ground floor plan was designed to have the kitchen usually in a projection that spanned half the width of the house, and allowed the living room at the back to have a window facing the backyard. Extensions, particularly those added to the side of these projections, limit the natural lighting. As one interview participant, Jacob, summarised: ‘you could square it off but that becomes light and the bit in the middle of the house becomes dark again’. Removal of walls and addition of large openings on ground floors, combined with the use of skylights and wide glazed windows, was the most common strategy to help mitigate the issues of natural lighting in new ground floor layouts. As Roshini explained:
            </p>
            <p class="ptext quote">currently […] when you're going down the corridor to the kitchen from the front door […] under the stairs, there's some storage and there's a toilet under there. And on the other side, there's kind of a little block that has got a door to it and that's got our washing machine boiler in. […] We could have extended that cupboard and made it more of a utility room. But we decided against that because it would have meant less light into the living room […] and we wouldn't have had that kind of semi open plan feeling between the two.

            <p class="ptext">However, these also suggest that they can no longer be extended or accommodate more partitioned floor plans, limiting the long-term usability of floor plans. What does this mean in the present urgency to understand and develop roadmaps for retrofitting the older housing stock in line with the net zero targets? These questions require a holistic approach integrating both architectural perspectives and qualitative designs with homeowners.
